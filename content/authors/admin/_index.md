#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me
I'm currently a 4th-year Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/). Previously I received my B.Sc. from Department of Math, UCLA, and M.Sc. from Department of Computer Science, UCLA. During that time, I've been an student researcher at [UCLA-NLP](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/members/) group with [Prof. Kai-Wei Chang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/).

My research interests focus on post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, I'm interested in aspects including alignment fine-tuning, self-training and hallucination problems. I also work on robustness and multi-modal learning.
